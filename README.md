# Portfolio 2.0 

this is the second iteration of my portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description 

Most of the projects here are carried over from my last portfolio to this new one but it was in need of a good house cleaning,nuke and pave.

## Tech
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
npm install node-sass
npm install styled-components
